# Madison-Sherlock-Wordle-Recreation
A recreation of the game Wordle. Will need a python shell/interpreter to play (Created May 2, 2022)

In order to use projWordle, you will need to have projWordle.py and five-letter-words.csv in the same folder, and a python shell will be needed to compile and execute projWordle.py. 

Once compiled/executed, you will need to enter main(seed), with seed being any number to generate a consistent level of randomness.
